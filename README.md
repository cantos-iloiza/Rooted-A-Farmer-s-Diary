# Rooted-A-Farmer-s-Diary 
About: (unedited)
This project aims to assist small-scale and home-based farmers by helping them monitor crop growth, providing reminders for watering and fertilizing schedules, and identifying the best planting times for seasonal vegetables. The system focuses on vegetables that can be grown in backyard gardens, supporting SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).
